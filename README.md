# roman-numerals-converter

A roman number converter that converts any integer between 1 and 3999 into a roman string.

The converter returns roman numerals in `subtractive notation`. Learn more about the ancient Rome numeral system: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Standard_form

To get some sample data for testing, I used this source: https://www.math-salamanders.com/roman-numerals-list.html
